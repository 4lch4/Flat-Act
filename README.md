# @4lch4/flat

This project is a GitHub action based on the original Flat Action published by GitHub OCTO (Office of the CTO).

The original project utilized Deno under the hood for the actual processing of the actions. While that's nice, I've had nothing but trouble working with it myself. As a result, I'm gonna try and create my own version that'll run either PowerShell, Bash, or regular ol' Node.js.
